# Calculator
# Overview
A calculator is a fundamental tool that provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project aims to develop a web-based calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator will offer a user-friendly interface and be responsive, making it accessible across different devices and screen sizes.
# Problem Statement
Many web-based calculators lack user-friendly interfaces or have limited functionality. Additionally, building a calculator that handles various arithmetic operations accurately and efficiently can be challenging. There is a need for a simple, reliable, and visually appealing calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations and possibly more advanced functions.
# Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To develop a functional and accurate web-based calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. To create a user-friendly and intuitive interface for the calculator.
3. To ensure the calculator is responsive and works well on different devices.
4. To provide a learning resource for beginners in web development, demonstrating the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
